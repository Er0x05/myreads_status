# MyReads Project

This is one simple book-list app by react.

You can search books you want in it. There is a booksAPI for you to search books ( the API is for practice, so it has few books. ), and record status about "reading" "want to read" "have read" for every book.

P.S I am gonna update it for more function. Thanks.
